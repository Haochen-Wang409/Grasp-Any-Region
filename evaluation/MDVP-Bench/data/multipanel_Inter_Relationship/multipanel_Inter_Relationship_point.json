The sequence in this case is non-traditional, as not all twelve signs are shown, and the usual order is somewhat shuffled. Traditionally, the signs are ordered as follows: Aries (Region 1), Taurus (Region 2), Gemini (Region 3), Cancer (Region 4), Leo (Region 5), Virgo (Region 6), Libra (Region 7), Scorpio (Region 8), Sagittarius (Region 9), Capricorn (Region 10), followed by Aquarius and Pisces, which are not labeled in this series.
