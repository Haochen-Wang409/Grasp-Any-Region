The table includes columns for model variations and their corresponding F1 scores across different categories such as Text, Title, List, Figure, and Table Average. The table is used to show quantitative results to compare the performance of the model variations.\n<Mark 5>: This paragraph discusses the beneficial aspects of perceptual features in document layout analysis and notes improvements of the VITLayout model. It suggests that the VITLayout has been applied to various tasks. It also mentions that the model can accurately locate and classify text and table information from thousands of grant applications, demonstrating practical applications and suggesting an area for future attention.\n<Mark 6>: This paragraph provides an analysis and commentary on the performance of the VITLayout model. The author reflects on the state-of-the-art performance and identifies areas for improvement and future research avenues, such as optimizing multimodal fusion in DLA and creating an end-to-end, lighter DLA model.",

Specifically, it describes how these vehicles, if unable to confirm the presence of a detected landmark, provide backend servers with information such as time, perspective, sensors used, and weather conditions to improve the landmark database. The process is said to be conducted under privacy considerations to ensure data anonymization.\n<Mark 2>: The text in this region elaborates on the statistical evaluation of confirmations and denials regarding landmarks. It touches on the false-positive and false-negative scenarios associated with landmark detection and emphasizes the need for aggregation and statistical validation of information by backend servers. Additionally, it mentions the importance of integrating context information, such as geographical adjustments and weather data, in enhancing the system's detection capabilities.\n<Mark 3>: This section outlines how particular sensory-related attributes, or 'environmental features,' are appended to the map as metadata, enabling vehicles to attribute specific characteristics to landmarks. This provision of additional details not only enriches the map's data but also prevents unnecessary communication of delete hypotheses to the backend server\u2014ultimately improving the efficiency of information sharing among vehicles considering the same landmarks in their navigation.\n<Mark 4>: The text describes a scenario where multiple vehicles fail to confirm a previously detected landmark. In such cases, a delete hypothesis is reinforced each time a vehicle fails to detect the landmark, leading to its removal from the map database. The text underscores the collaborative effort of vehicles in maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the map system by reporting changes in landmark presence.\n<Mark 5>: In this region, the text specifies the process following the strengthening of a delete hypothesis. When a landmark's deletion is validated, the map segment is updated, and an updated version is made available to the vehicles. This ensures that the vehicles have access to the most accurate navigation data, reflecting the current environment without the invalidated landmark.",

Assets are listed at the top part, showing various types of assets such as current assets and property, with numerical values next to each item indicating their reported values in dollar amounts. This table is essential for providing a clear and itemized account of the company's financial status for the two respective years.\n<Mark 3>: Marked as a \"section-header,\" this region represents the title of a section within the financial document, in this case, \"CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\" The stylized font and the use of dots to draw attention suggest that this header is for an important section of the document, likely introducing the subsequent detailed table of financial data.\n<Mark 4>: This region, identified as \"text,\" contains the concluding line of the financial table, summarizing the total liabilities and stockholders' equity. The text provides the final aggregated figures for both 2003 and 2004 in dollars, directly under the liabilities and equity section. This line is crucial as it ties together the document's purpose by showing the balance sheet's bottom line, ensuring the accounting equation is satisfied (total assets equal total liabilities plus stockholders' equity).",
